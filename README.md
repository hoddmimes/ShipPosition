An IOS App for uploading ship position to the SailTracker server.

SailTracker is a Web App that allows long distance sailing adventures to allow near and love ones to follow their journeys.

**ShipPosition** is an auxiliary App for reporting a boat position to the *SailTracking* *server*.

Typically the SailTrack server automatically will collect a boat position via some public online AIS service. However only boat positions reported via land based AIS stations are publicly available. Satellite collected position are available as paid service.

Since this is a hobby project which does not have a paid subscriptions, satellite positions are not collected and available in the SailTracker server.

The **ShipPosition** App is a Iphone App that can collect and save positions when being out of reach of a land based AIS receiver and not having an Internet connection . 

When reaching a port and having an Internet collected positions in the *ShipPosition* App can be uploaded to the SailTracker server.
